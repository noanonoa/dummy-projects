    Ask the user for an input.
    This could be anything such as a name, an adjective, a pronoun or even an action. Once you get the input, you can rearrange it to build up your own story.

    Here's a youtube tutorial on mad libs in Python. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7g9mRzQLYE)
    And example code on Github. (https://github.com/ChalzZy/Mad-Libs-Generator/blob/master/Mad_Libs_Generator/main.py)

I'll be <span>${result[1]}</span> honest: I have to take a big <span>${result[2]}</span> in the bathroom, and I need to find a stall with a strong Wi-Fi signal.  I mean, data plans are <span>${result[3]}</span> expensive, and without being too specific, I'm going to be in there for a very, very <span>${result[4]}</span> time.  I had the lunch special at Cafe el <span>${result[5]}</span> and it's like a ticking time <span>${result[6]}</span> in my <span>${result[7]}</span>, if you know what I mean.  Anyway, since they removed the <span>${result[8]}</span> magazines from the men's bathroom, I have a difficult time concentrating on the <span>${result[9]}</span> at hand.  The women's restroom is right next door.  So if you don't mind, go in, check out the Wi-Fi and tell me which area has the most <span>${result[10]}</span> signal.  I would do it myself, but once I sit down, I'm commited for at least <span>${result[11]}</span> minutes.  We can't be <span>${result[12]}</span> obvious about this, though, so be <span>${result[13]}</span>.  Got it?  Good.  Now, please hurry.  The turtle is starting to poke his head out of his <span>${result[14]}</span>, if you know what I mean.`
