    /*
    Word count
    Ask the user what's on their mind. Then after the user responds, 
    count the number of words in the sentence and print that as an output.

    Example:

    Prompt: what's on your mind today?
    Input: well, it's just a day for me to be an expert in coding
    Output: oh nice, you just told me what's on your mind in 13 words!
    To take this a step further, open a file that is handed to you, count the number of words in there, then print it out.
    */

    const userInput = prompt("What's on your mind today?");
    const inputLength = userInput.split(" ").length;

    const output = document.querySelector("h1");
    output.innerHTML = `Oh nice, you just told me what's on your mind in ${inputLength} words!`;
