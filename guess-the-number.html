// Guess the number

// You ask a user to guess a number between 1 and 50.
// If they guess outside that range, you prompt with an error encouraging them to choose a number within the proper range.
// Whenever they guess the wrong number you ask if they want to keep playing or if they'd like to quit.
// Finally, when the user eventually guesses the right number you congratulate them and show the number of attempts they had.
